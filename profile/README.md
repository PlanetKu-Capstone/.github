Accumulated waste not only poses a threat to the environment and public health, but also contributes significantly to increased carbon emissions, which exacerbates global warming and accelerates climate change. Based on data from the National Waste Management Information System (SIPSN), the national waste stockpile in 2021 was recorded at 28.5 million tons, increasing to 38.2 million tons in 2023. This growth shows an alarming pattern of increase, as carbon emissions continue to grow. In addition, floods that often occur during rainy days are getting worse due to the accumulation of waste that clogs the flow of water. 

This research aims to answer the main questions: Why does waste continue to accumulate every year, why do floods become more frequent during rainy days, and how can waste management help reduce carbon emissions? We wanted to create a PlanetKu app that could help people to support a healthier environment.

With PlanetKu, we are committed to creating a healthier earth, reducing carbon emissions, and encouraging. We hope that people's awareness of environmental issues will be better, we hope that people can properly process their own waste so that the surrounding environment will be well preserved, and people's knowledge of environmental issues can increase.
